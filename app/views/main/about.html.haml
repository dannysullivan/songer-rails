      %h1 About Songer
      %p Songer is an automatic songwriting tool. It builds melodies around basic rhythmic patterns, then generates lyrics to fit those melodies. A MIDI rendition of the results can be played in the browser (currently disabled on mobile), and the lyrics are highlighted karoake-style so that the user can sing along.

      %h2 Lyrics
      %p Currently, lyrics are generated by randomly selecting common one-syllable English words and chaining them together. Going forward, the plan is to allow for words of any length and base lyrics on interesting (and possibly user-supplied) sources.

      %h2 Music
      %p All music generated by Songer at the moment follows simple chord changes, repetitive rhythmic structures, and all melodies are based around the pentatonic scale (which sounds reasonable in most contexts). The plan is to continue to base melodies around repetitive melodies but allow for more melodic and harmonic flexibility in the hopes that Songer will come up with interesting musical ideas that might not occur to human songwriters.
